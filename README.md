# SALARY CALCULATOR

## Description

_Duration: 2 Week Sprint_

This is an application that records employee salaries and calculates the simple monthly costs incurred when paying those salaries.  The app assumes a monthly budget of $20,000 and indicates if that budget has been exceeded by changing the footer color to red.  It also allows you to remove an employee from the record and recalculates costs after doing so.

This app is not currently deployed.
